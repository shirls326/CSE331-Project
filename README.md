# CSE331 Project


## Notes
- Node is required to run this so install node before trying to run
- Run on Chrome as Safari may apply some styles weird and not as the intended product


## How to compile

1. Open a new terminal
2. Type the following command `npm i`. This will install all of the neccesary packages in order to run the code
3. Once all the packages are downloaded, then type in the following command `npm run dev`. This will allow you to view the website via your localhost. The port will be included in the same terminal that you ran that command
4. In order to end the program, click on the same terminal running the previous command and press CTRL + C (Specifically control for MacOS)
